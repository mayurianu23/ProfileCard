🌟 Profile Card UI Design

This project is a simple and elegant profile card interface built using HTML and CSS. It showcases a clean, modern layout designed to highlight an individual’s profile with an image, name, bio, social media links, and interactive buttons. The design focuses on responsive styling, smooth alignment, and user-friendly presentation.

This project demonstrates my front-end design skills and understanding of CSS layout techniques like flexbox, spacing, and color balance. It’s ideal for use in portfolios, personal websites, or social networking applications.

Through this project, I aimed to practice building aesthetic and functional UI components that reflect real-world design principles. It serves as a great starting point for beginners who want to learn how to combine HTML and CSS to create interactive and visually appealing profile cards.
